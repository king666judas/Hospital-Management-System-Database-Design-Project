Steps for Implementation

1. Entity Design:
    > Tables:
        > Doctors, 
        > Patients, 
        > Appointments, and 
        > Departments.
    > Each table will have a primary key and necessary foreign keys will be added for relationships.

2. Relationships:
    > Doctors work in Departments                       (1-to-1 or many-to-1 relationship).
    > Patients can have multiple Appointments           (1-to-many relationship).
    > Appointments are assigned to Doctors and Patients (many-to-1 for both).

3. SQL Queries:
    > Define tables with relationships using FOREIGN KEY.
    > Insert dummy data.

4. ER Diagram:
    > Create an ER diagram using a tool like Lucidchart, dbdiagram.io, or similar software.

5. Submission:
    > Include the ER diagram as an image.
    > SQL scripts in a text file.
    > Combine them into a zip file or upload them to GitHub.
